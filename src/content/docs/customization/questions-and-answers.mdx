## What is Q&A?

The Q&A feature in ThreadScribe allows users to fine-tune their copilot by 
providing specific question-and-answer response pairs. This customization 
enhances the copilotâ€™s ability to respond accurately and contextually to 
queries, making it a more effective tool for retrieving information and 
assisting users.

## Configuring Q&A
