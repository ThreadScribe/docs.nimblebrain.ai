    <Aside>Summaries generally take about 5-10 second to generate, depending on the length of the thread. If no response is received, please let us know by contacting us via [support](/support/).</Aside>

3. ## Search your summaries


    In a channel that ThreadScribe is in, you can ask it any question.
    
    For example, `@ThreadScribe What does the latest market research indicate about our effective reach?`

    ThreadScribe will react with the eyes emoji (ðŸ‘€) which indicates that it has received the request. It will then post the response directly to the slack thread.
